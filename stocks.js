// I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:

// The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening
// time, which was 9:30am local time.
// The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
// For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am,
// so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

// Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best
// profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale
// of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

// No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.
// You may not buy and sell in the same time
// step (at least 1 minute must pass).


// keep track of the current min
// if a number comes along to create a better trade (is a max for the currentMin),
// the bestTrade min and max are updated.
// if a number comes along and is less than the current
// min, we update the current min, since going forward
// it will create the largest differences with the future potential maxes.
